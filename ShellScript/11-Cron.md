
## ‚è∞ Automating Backups with Cron (Linux)

This guide explains how to **automatically run your `backup.sh` script** using a cron job at regular intervals (daily, weekly, etc.).

---

### üìå What is Cron?

Cron is a Linux utility that lets you **schedule tasks** (called *cron jobs*) to run automatically at specified times or intervals.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* Your script (`backup.sh`) is working and executable
* The `zip` package is installed
* You have a valid source and destination directory

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x /home/ubuntu/script/backup.sh
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Open the Crontab Editor

Run:

```bash
crontab -e
```

---

> This opens your user‚Äôs cron configuration in the default text editor.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Add a Cron Job

Here‚Äôs a sample entry to run the backup script **every day at 2:00 AM**:

```cron
0 2 * * * /home/ubuntu/script/backup.sh /home/ubuntu/scripts /home/ubuntu/backup
```

### ‚è± Cron Timing Format

```
* * * * * command_to_run
| | | | |
| | | | +----- Day of the week (0 - 6) [Sunday = 0]
| | | +------- Month (1 - 12)
| | +--------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| +----------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

### üïí More Schedule Examples

| Time                | Cron Expression | Meaning                     |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Every day @ 2 AM    | `0 2 * * *`     | Daily backup at 2 AM        |
| Every hour          | `0 * * * *`     | Runs every hour on the hour |
| Every Sunday @ 1 AM | `0 1 * * 0`     | Weekly backup every Sunday  |

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Save and Exit

After adding the cron job, save and exit the editor.
Your backup script is now scheduled to run automatically!

---

### üîç Check if Cron is Running

Ensure the cron service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cron
```

---
Here‚Äôs how you can **check if your backup has been updated** and **view it using `ls`** after running the backup script:

---

### ‚úÖ Checking if Your Backup is Updated

After running the backup script, follow these steps to confirm your backup is updated:

1. **Navigate to the backup directory** where your backups are stored:

   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/backup
   ```

2. **List the files in the directory** to check for the most recent backup:

   ```bash
   ls -lh
   ```

   This will show a list of files, including the **timestamped backups**. For example:

   ```
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1.2G May 9 02:00 backups-2025-05-09_02-00-00.zip
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1.3G May 8 02:00 backups-2025-05-08_02-00-00.zip
   ```

3. **Check for the most recent backup file**. The file with the latest **timestamp** is the most recent backup.

### ‚úÖ Reference for Cron Scheduling

To ensure your cron jobs are set up correctly, you can use [**Crontab Guru**](https://crontab.guru/) ‚Äî a **Cron expression editor** that helps you visualize and understand the timing of cron jobs.

For example, to schedule your backup script every day at 2 AM:

```bash
0 2 * * * /home/ubuntu/script/backup.sh /home/ubuntu/scripts /home/ubuntu/backup
```

You can enter this cron expression into [**Crontab Guru**](https://crontab.guru/) to confirm its accuracy.

### üìù Summary of Commands

1. **Check backups**:

   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/backup
   ls -lh
   ```

2. **Check your cron schedule** using [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/).

Backups will be stored in the destination folder you provide, e.g.:

```
/home/ubuntu/backup/backups-YYYY-MM-DD.zip
```
