# 🌐 What is an Operating System (OS)?

An Operating System (OS) is software that helps a computer run. It manages the hardware (like CPU, RAM, disk) and allows other software (like browsers or apps) to work.

There are two main types of OS:
1. **Client OS** – for users or developers
2. **Server OS** – for running services and applications

## 👨‍💻 What is a Client OS?

A **Client OS** is used on laptops or desktop computers by users or developers.  
Example: Windows 10, Ubuntu Desktop, macOS

### 🧑‍🔧 DevOps Use:
- Write code using VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.
- Run Docker or test apps locally
- Connect to remote servers using SSH
- Push code to GitHub or GitLab

## 🖥️ What is a Server OS?

A **Server OS** runs on powerful computers (servers) used in offices, cloud, or data centers.  
Example: Ubuntu Server, CentOS, Amazon Linux

### 🧑‍🔧 DevOps Use:
- Run web apps and services (like Node.js, React)
- Run CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab Runner)
- Host Docker containers and Kubernetes
- Store and manage databases
- Monitor with Prometheus and Grafana

## 🔍 Simple Difference Table

| Feature            | Client OS               | Server OS                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Used by            | People (users/devs)      | Computers (as servers)     |
| Example            | Windows 10, macOS        | Ubuntu Server, Amazon Linux |
| Main job           | Development, browsing    | Hosting apps and websites |
| GUI (Graphical UI) | Yes                      | No or minimal              |
| DevOps Use         | Write & test code        | Run pipelines & apps       |

## 🧰 How DevOps Works with OS

### Example Scenario:

1. 👨‍💻 **Developer** works on a **Client OS** (like Windows or Ubuntu Desktop).
2. 🧑‍💻 They push code to GitHub or GitLab.
3. 🖥️ A **Server OS** (like Ubuntu Server) takes the code and runs it using:
   - GitLab Runner
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes
4. 👀 The app is then visible on a website or cloud server.

## ✅ Why DevOps Engineers Use Linux Server OS

- It’s fast and light
- Easy to use with command line
- Works well with Docker, Kubernetes
- Default for cloud servers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Easier to automate tasks
